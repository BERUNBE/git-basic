
Barbarian creatures are generally slow, but have high Attack skills and hit points. While
 excellent in the early and midgame, the Barbarian creatures begin to falter towards the
 endgame. The early game advantage is accented in small and medium maps.

Sorceress creatures are generally very fast, but have low hit points. Weak in the early
 game, and moderate at best in the endgame, the Sorceress creatures are the best in the 
midgame. The combination of speed, flying, and range attack becomes incredibly
 potent. Medium maps are perfect for Sorceress creatures.

Wizard creatures have a little of everything, some toughness, some speed, some range 
strike ability. Like the Necromancer, the Wizard is weak in the early game, strong in the
 midgame, and challenges the Warlock for endgame power. Titans and Archmages are
 the best range strike creatures around, and Titans match up to Dragons in power.
