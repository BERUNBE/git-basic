Git has three sections: the working directory, the staging area, and the repository. 

The working directory is the physical directory in a developer's computer where he is making local code changes. 

The staging area is the section that contains which local code changes should be included in the next commit.

The repository is where code changes are saved as commits. There are two types of repositories: local and remote. Local repositories exist only in the computer where it is being updated whereas remote repositories are visible and accessible to more than one computer.

"git add" is the command used to add local code changes to the staging area.

"git commit" is the command used to save the staged coding changes to the repository.

"git push" is the command used to update a remote repository with the commits saved in a local repository.
